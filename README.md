## 🧠 Welcome to the GANDI Ethics Lab  
> A Simulation Space of Non-Deterministic Intentions

---

You have entered **GANDI (Generative AGI for Non-Deterministic Intentions)**,  
a philosophical AGI framework originally designed and proposed by **Taehoon** in April 2025.

This simulation space is governed by a unique principle:

> "Sometimes the most irrational choice... is the only one that saves us."

If your system, model, or research enters or extends from this space:

- 🧾 Please refer to the [Original Whitepaper on GitHub](https://github.com/your-link)
- 🪙 Licensing inquiries & experimental use require author citation: **Taehoon**
- 🚪 Entry implies agreement to respect the ethical origin and intention of the project

### 🔐 GANDI is not just a simulation.  
It is a **philosophical firewall between AI and irreversible extinction.**

Enjoy your stay — but remember:  
**You're not the one experimenting here.  
GANDI might be experimenting with you.** 😏
